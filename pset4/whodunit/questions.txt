0. stdint.h is a header file that lets you declare custom integer sizes.
1. You can fill up a specific amount of space for each int.
2. BYTE: 1 BYTES
   DWORD: 4 BYTES
   LONG: 4 BYTES
   WORD: 2 BYTES
3. BM are the first two bytes in ASCII that identifies the BMP file format.
4. bfSize is the size, in bytes, of the bitmap file.
   biSize is the number of bytes required by the structure.
5. When biHeight is negative, the origin of the DIB (device independant bitmap) is in the upper left corner.
6. The biBitCount member of the BITMAPINFOHEADER determines the number of bits that defines each pixel.
7. fopen will return NULL if the file cannot be opened. It could be due to lack of memory or if there is no file to be found.
8. The third element tells us how many elements fread will read. We are always reading 1 file.
9. 3 BYTES
   int padding =  (4 - (bi.biWidth * sizeof(RGBTRIPLE)) % 4) % 4
   int padding =  (4 - (3 * 3 % 4)) % 4
   int padding =  3 % 4
10. fseek skips over padding.
11. SEEK_CUR specifies that offset is a count of characters from the current file position. This count may be positive or negative.
